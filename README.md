# Super-Mario-Bros
Helloo!!

This is a fun school math project that I made for vector analysis applications. In this project, I try to recreate the infamous and classic game "Super Mario Bros" using Unity software. This means, i use mostly C# as the primary development tool for physics and data mapping. You can find all of my scripts in the "assets" folder (others are mostly just unity included programms)

To run this game, you need to download unity and start a new project. Download all the prefabs, sprites, and scenes. Dont forget to copy my "physics" and "scripts" code too!

Your own personal touches is ofcourse needed to make the map and terrain itself =)
